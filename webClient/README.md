ReactJS side; includes:\
  -Home Page, showing list of items fetched from backend, ability to add, rename, alter target quantity of, toggle "having bought", and delete items (updates backend accordingly)\
  -Profile page, showing list of bought items and slightly buggy profile information\
    (something with the page's data updating when receiving new data won't cooperate, thus showing default test data)\
  -Ability to navigate between them
